      <description>In classical economics, a potential offender is treated as a rational agent that seeks to maximize the expected utility when deciding to commit a crime. Therefore, if the threat of legal punishment outweights the perceived gain from crime, then the offender is deterred. However, in reality, there are complex behavioral traits governing the actions of each individuals that deviate from rationality, and these effects need to be captured in order to construct an economic model of deterrence.</description>
