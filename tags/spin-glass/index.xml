      <description>Unlike ferromagnetic spin models, the phase transition profile of a spin glass is highly non-trivial. For mean field models (the SK spin glass), the glass experiences a replica-symmetry breaking phenomenon that is only fully understood recently. However, for short-range models (the EA spin glass), essentially nothing is known rigorously, including basic questions such as the existence of a finite-temperature phase transition. A potential route towards a solution of such problems may rely on a suitable generalization of the powerful random cluster model.</description>
