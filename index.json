This line of work developed in parallel with the broader SSM wave (Mamba, Gated Delta Net, etc.), cross-pollinating ideas around structured recurrences, parallel scans, and kernel parameterizations.\nThe project resulted in several publications:\nTENNsEye (CVPR 2024 Workshop) — A lightweight causal spatiotemporal network for online eye tracking with event cameras. Targets edge hardware via simple operations (convolutions, ReLU), online inference through output buffering, and \u0026gt;90% activation sparsity through regularization. Reached 0.9916 p10 accuracy on the AIS 2024 challenge.\nCentaurus (ICLR 2025 Spotlight, solo author) — Treats SSM operations as tensor contractions and systematically determines their optimal ordering to maximize training efficiency. This unlocks flexible SSM block designs beyond depthwise-separable configurations — group convolutions, full convolutions, bottleneck blocks — all composed into a heterogeneous architecture. The first fully state-space network with competitive ASR performance without LSTMs, explicit convolutions, or attention.\naTENNuate (Interspeech 2025) — A deep state-space autoencoder for real-time raw speech enhancement. Processes waveforms end-to-end with no spectral pre/post-processing, outperforming prior real-time denoising models in PESQ while using only 0.84M parameters and 0.33G MACs. Remains performant even when input is compressed down to 4000 Hz and 4 bits.\nPLEIADES (NeurIPS 2025) — Uses structured temporal kernels based on orthogonal polynomials for online spatiotemporal classification and detection. Handles variable sample rates and discretization step-sizes without fine-tuning. Achieved state-of-the-art on DVS128 gesture recognition (99.6%), AIS 2024 eye tracking (99.6%), and PROPHESEE 1MP automotive detection (0.556 mAP) — all with sub-million parameter counts.\nOn the side, I also put together mamba-tiny — a minimal single-file PyTorch implementation of the Mamba SSM using logcumsumexp as an alternative to the parallel scan (which wasn\u0026rsquo;t available in PyTorch at the time).\nBack to projects\n","permalink":"https://peabrane.github.io/post/tenns/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eWhile working at \u003ca href=\"https://brainchip.com/\"\u003eBrainChip\u003c/a\u003e, I led the research and software-hardware codesign of TENNs (Temporal Neural Networks) — a family of deep state-space models designed for efficient, low-latency inference on edge hardware.

A potential route towards settling such problems may rely on a suitable generalization of the random cluster model as a universal statistical tool.\nUsing a graphical representation for the Ising spin-glass known as the Chayes-Machta-Redner (CMR) representation combined with a contour argument, we were able to rigorously prove the existence of a finite-temperature phsae transition for the Ising spin-glass of geometric nature. The low-temperature phase is characterized by the coexistence of multiple infinite clusters that are separated spatially and negatively correlated with each other in their spin-overlaps, as shown in the figure below.\rBack to projects\n","permalink":"https://peabrane.github.io/post/glass/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eUnlike ferromagnetic spin models, a \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_glass\"\u003espin glass\u003c/a\u003e has a highly non-trivial phase transition profile.
