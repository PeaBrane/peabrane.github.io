[{"content":"Unlike ferromagnetic spin models, the phase transition profile of a spin glass is highly non-trivial. For mean field models (the SK spin glass), the glass experiences a replica-symmetry breaking phenomenon that is only fully understood recently. However, for short-range models (the EA spin glass), essentially nothing is known rigorously, including basic questions such as the existence of a finite-temperature phase transition. A potential route towards a solution of such problems may rely on a suitable generalization of the powerful random cluster model.\n","date":"2020-08-12","permalink":"https://peabrane.github.io/post/glass/","tags":["spin glass"],"title":"Phase Transition in Spin Glass"},{"content":"The universality classes of equilibrium phase transitions of many statistical models are well known. On the other hand, very little is understood about the phenomenon of non-equilibrium criticality, including its existence. Nonetheless, from numerical simulations, it appears that memory effects are fundamental driving forces behind dynamic criticality, as they establish long-range order irrespective of the equilibrium model. A theoretical understanding of the role of memory in complex systems is important to understanding critical phenomenon as a whole.\n","date":"2020-03-15","permalink":"https://peabrane.github.io/post/memory/","tags":["memory"],"title":"Non-equilibrium Criticality of Memory"},{"content":"In classical economics, a potential offender is treated as a rational agent that seeks to maximize the expected utility when deciding to commit a crime. Therefore, if the threat of legal punishment outweights the perceived gain from crime, then the offender is deterred. However, in reality, there are complex behavioral traits governing the actions of each individuals that deviate from rationality, and these effects need to be captured in order to construct an economic model of deterrence.\n","date":"2019-09-01","permalink":"https://peabrane.github.io/post/deterrence/","tags":["criminology"],"title":"Optimal Deterrence Based on Behavioral Traits"},{"content":"On a signed graph (or spin glass), often times there are interactions that cannot be satisfied no matter how one assigns the spin state. This property is known as frustration. The study of frustration of a bipartite graph is an active topic in graph theory, and has some important applications in unsupervised learning. For instance, a highly frustrated RBM has several desirable statistical properties, such as the correspondence between the joint and marginal distribution, that can be leveraged to achieve more efficient training.\n","date":"2019-03-01","permalink":"https://peabrane.github.io/post/rbm/","tags":["frustration","rbm"],"title":"Frustration and Unsupervised Learning"}]
